        <p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with services. You may request deletion of your account and associated data as described in the Account Deletion section below.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the following rights regarding your personal information:</p>

        </ul>
        <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact information provided below.</p>

        <h2>Account Deletion</h2>
        <p>You may request deletion of your Connect account at any time by contacting us at <strong>official.connectapp@gmail.com</strong>. When you delete your account:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your account will be deactivated and removed from the app</li>

            <li>We may retain certain information for legal compliance, fraud prevention, or legitimate business purposes as permitted by law</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Connect is designed for users 13 years of age and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information and terminate the child's account. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately at <strong>official.connectapp@gmail.com</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Location Data</h2>
        <p><strong>Foreground Location Only:</strong> Connect only collects location data while the app is in active use (in the foreground). We do not collect background location data. This data is used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Show you nearby events and activities</li>
            <li>Display your approximate location to friends (if you have chosen to share it)</li>
            <li>Improve event discovery and recommendations</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Your Control:</strong> You can disable location sharing at any time through your device's location settings or through the app's permission settings. Disabling location will limit your ability to discover nearby events but will not affect other app features.</p>
        <p><strong>Privacy Note:</strong> Your precise location is not stored on our servers. We only use your location to provide nearby recommendations and then discard the precise coordinates.</p>

        <h2>Push Notifications</h2>
        <p>Connect uses push notifications to notify you about friend activity, event updates, messages, and app announcements. We collect device push notification tokens to send these notifications.</p>
        <p><strong>Managing Notifications:</strong> You can control push notifications by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adjusting notification settings within the Connect app</li>
            <li>Disabling notifications in your device's system settings</li>
            <li>Opting out of specific notification categories in your app preferences</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>GDPR & CCPA Compliance</h2>
        <p><strong>GDPR (European Users):</strong> If you are located in the European Economic Area, you have rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, data portability, and the right to withdraw consent.
