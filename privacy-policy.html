    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Covee! Covee is a social activity app that helps you create and join real-world activities with friends — from pickup basketball games to dinner plans to weekend trips. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.</p>
    <p>Covee is developed and operated by an independent developer based in the United States. By using Covee, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Information You Provide Directly</h3>
    <p>When you create an account and use Covee, you may provide us with the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Full name</strong> — used to identify you within the app and to your friends.</li>
      <li><strong>Email address</strong> — used for account creation, login, and communication about your account.</li>
      <li><strong>Phone number</strong> — used for account verification and to help friends find you on Covee.</li>
      <li><strong>Profile photo</strong> — uploaded from your device's camera or photo library, displayed on your profile and visible to your friends.</li>
      <li><strong>Bio</strong> — an optional, user-written description displayed on your profile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User-Generated Content</h3>
    <p>When you use Covee's features, you create content that we store on your behalf:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Activity and event listings</strong> — including title, description, date, time, location, and category.</li>
      <li><strong>Chat messages</strong> — messages you send within activity group chats.</li>
      <li><strong>Friend connections</strong> — your friend list and any friend requests you send or receive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Location Data</h3>
    <p>Covee collects location data in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Foreground GPS location</strong> — when the app is actively in use and you have granted location permission, we access your device's GPS to show nearby events and to attach a location to activities you create. Covee does not collect location data in the background.</li>
      <li><strong>Text-based location input</strong> — when you type a location for an event, that text is converted to geographic coordinates using the Expo Location service on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Device and Usage Data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Push notification token</strong> — when you enable push notifications, we collect a device token generated by the Expo Push Notification service. This token is stored in our database and used solely to deliver notifications to your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Device type</strong> — we collect basic device information (such as whether you are using an iPhone or Android device) to ensure push notifications are delivered correctly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To provide and operate the app</strong> — creating your account, displaying your profile, and enabling you to create, discover, and join activities with friends.</li>
      <li><strong>To facilitate social features</strong> — connecting you with friends, displaying your name and photo to other users you are connected with, and powering group chats within activities.</li>
      <li><strong>To show relevant activities nearby</strong> — using your foreground location to surface events and activities in your area.</li>
      <li><strong>To send push notifications</strong> — alerting you about friend requests, activity invitations, chat messages, upcoming events, and other app-related updates.</li>
      <li><strong>To communicate with you</strong> — sending account-related emails such as verification messages or responses to support requests.</li>
      <li><strong>To improve and maintain the app</strong> — understanding how features are used so we can fix issues and make Covee better.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information Sharing</h2>

    <h3>With Other Covee Users</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Your <strong>name and profile photo</strong> are visible to other Covee users who are your friends.</li>
      <li><strong>Activity details</strong> you create are visible to your friends or to users you specifically invite (for private events).</li>
      <li><strong>Chat messages</strong> are visible to other participants in the same activity group chat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>With Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
    <p>We use the following third-party services to operate Covee. These providers process your data on our behalf and are subject to their own privacy policies:</p>

    </ul>
    <p>If you are a resident of California or another jurisdiction that grants additional privacy rights, you may have additional rights under applicable law, including the right to know what data we collect, the right to request deletion, and the right to opt out of the sale of personal data (though we do not sell personal data).</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Covee is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information as quickly as possible.</p>

    <p>Users between the ages of 13 and 17 may use Covee with the consent of a parent or guardian.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. These measures include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using Firebase's built-in security infrastructure, including encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS).</li>
      <li>Implementing Firebase Security Rules to restrict data access based on authentication status and user identity.</li>
      <li>Storing authentication credentials securely through Firebase Authentication.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While we work hard to protect your information, no method of electronic storage or internet transmission is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security, but we are committed to following industry best practices to safeguard your data.</p>
